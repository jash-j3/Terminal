MYPS(1)
NAME
       myps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       myps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       myps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use top instead.

       This version of myps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to the many standards and myps implementations that
       this myps is compatible with.
