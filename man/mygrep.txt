MYGREP(1)
NAME
       mygrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       mygrep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       mygrep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       mygrep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       mygrep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted
       when grep is used in a shell command.

       A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.
